<!-- The template system uses dot-lookup syntax to access variable attributes. In the example of {{ question.question_text }}, first Django does a dictionary lookup on the object question. Failing that, it tries an attribute lookup – which works, in this case. If attribute lookup had failed, it would’ve tried a list-index lookup. -->

<h1>{{ question.question_text }}</h1>
<ul>
{% for choice in question.choice_set.all %}
	<li>{{ choice.choice_text }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
